# 100 days of code (for real this time) 🌈✨

Hi there 👋🏼 welcome to my 100 Days of Code journey! This will not be my first time doing this, but it will be my first time completing it (I hope!). Normally I'd [fork the 100 Days of Code repo](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code) to get this done, but I wanted a clean setup.

I’ll be coding at least one hour a day, focusing on Python, FastAPI, scalable APIs, React, Node, and the AT Protocol. My goal is to rebuild my skills, learn new ones, ship small projects that align with my values, and stay accountable while I work toward backend roles that feel like a good fit. If you're curious, visit the [official 100 Days of Code site](http://100daysofcode.com/) to join the challenge.

Feedback and ideas are always welcome.

Thanks for being here 💛
